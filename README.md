# LaunchKit

LaunchKit is a library for building custom tools for GPTs with tool-use support.
Define your own tools as type annotated functions and LaunchKit will help you test, talk to, and deploy your tools.

LaunchKit is using Pydantic under the hood to validate and parse functions to make them friendly to for AI APIs.

### Getting started

2. Create a new project

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
pdm init --copier gh:missioncontrolai/template
pdm install
```

3. Test it out

```bash
pdm test # run tests
pdm dev # talk with your bot
```

4. Deploy it (with MissionControl)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

- Create a new repo on github and push to it.
